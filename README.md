# WindozeXP 1080 Plymouth theme

I just edited the work of LASZCZ (https://www.pling.com/p/1202116/) by scaling it to 1080p and adding some loading frames.
I also translated the copyright to english.

Just run `./install` to install it.
You can run `./test-plymouth` to display the current bootsplash theme.
